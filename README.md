# PorscheConnEx

PorscheConnEx (aka PCX) is a library for connecting to the Porsche Connect API, to monitor and control your Porsche vehicle.

## Installation

PorscheConnEx requires Elixir v1.15 or later.  To use it, add `:porsche_conn_ex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:porsche_conn_ex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

```elixir
# Start a PorscheConnEx session:
{:ok, pid} = PorscheConnEx.Session.start_link(credentials: %{
  username: "user@domain.com", 
  password: "my_password"
}, name: MySession)

# Get a list of vehicles:
{:ok, vehicles} = PorscheConnEx.Client.vehicles(pid)

# Get a summary of the first vehicle (and output it):
vin = List.first(vehicles).vin
{:ok, summary} = PorscheConnEx.Client.summary(pid, vin)
summary |> IO.inspect(label: "Summary")

# Get the vehicle model:
{:ok, capabilities} = PorscheConnEx.Client.capabilities(pid, vin)
model = capabilities.car_model

# Get the current emobility data:
{:ok, emobility} = PorscheConnEx.Client.emobility(pid, vin, model)

# Output the current battery charge and estimated remaining distance:
emobility.charging.percent |> IO.inspect(label: "Percent charged")
emobility.charging.remaining_electric_range |> IO.inspect(label: "Remaining range")

# There's a lot of overlap in the various API calls -- you can get the same
# data via both `status/2` and `stored_overview/2`.  For example:
{:ok, status} = PorscheConnEx.Client.status(pid, vin)
{status.battery_level, status.remaining_ranges.electric.distance} |> IO.inspect(label: "Status")

# If you want the most current data, you can use `current_overview/2`, but it's slowww:
{:ok, pending} = PorscheConnEx.Client.current_overview(pid, vin)
{:ok, overview} = PorscheConnEx.Client.wait(pid, pending)
{overview.battery_level, overview.remaining_ranges.electric.distance} |> IO.inspect(label: "Overview")

# And since we named the process `MySession`, we can use that instead:
{:ok, position} = PorscheConnEx.Client.position(MySession, vin)
position.coordinates |> IO.inspect(label: "Position")
```

Output:

```elixir
Summary: %PorscheConnEx.Struct.Summary{model_description: "Taycan GTS", nickname: nil}
Percent charged: 80
Remaining range: #PCX:Distance<261.0 km>
Status: {#PCX:BatteryLevel<80%>, #PCX:Distance<261.0 km>}
Overview: {#PCX:BatteryLevel<80%>, #PCX:Distance<261.0 km>}
Position: %PorscheConnEx.Struct.Position.Coordinates{
  latitude: 45.678901,
  longitude: -76.543210,
  reference_system: :wgs84
}
```
